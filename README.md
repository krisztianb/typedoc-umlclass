# typedoc-umlclass

**Plugin for TypeDoc that generates UML class diagrams**

## Usage

TypeDoc automatically detects plugins installed via npm. After installation TypeDoc can be used normally and
this plugin is going to create a UML class diagram for every class and interface within your project.

Example:

![Example default style](https://krisztianb.github.io/typedoc-umlclass/docs/human-default-layout.png)

## Installation

The plugin can then be installed using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typedoc-umlclass):

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev typedoc-umlclass
```

## Requirements

The plugin requires the following software to be installed on your system:

* [JAVA](https://www.java.com/) (latest version)
* [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) (latest version)
* [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) (supported versions: 0.23.x and above)

Version **0.23.x** of TypeDoc automatically detects plugins installed via npm.
If you are using version **0.24.x** or above you need to [activate the plugin with a command line argument](https://typedoc.org/options/configuration/#plugin).

After installation TypeDoc can be used normally and you can configure this plugin as described below.

## Options

The option `umlClassDiagram` is added to TypeDoc when the plugin is installed. The option is an object whose properties
can be used to configure the plugin within your [TypeDoc config file](https://typedoc.org/guides/options/).
Here is an example using a strictly-typed JavaScript config file:

```js
/** @type { import('typedoc').TypeDocOptionMap & import('typedoc-umlclass').Config } */
module.exports = {
    entryPoints: ["./src/index.ts"],
    out: "doc",
    plugin: ["typedoc-umlclass"],
    umlClassDiagram: {
        type: "detailed",
        location: "local",
        format: "svg"
    }
};
```

### Basic settings

| Name & Format | Description | Default |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------- |
| **type** `<none\|simple\|detailed>` | You can use this option to disable the plugin by passing the value `none`. Otherwise a class diagram is generated for every class and interface that is involved in inheritance and/or implementation. The class diagram includes one level of base and sub classes. Use the value `simple` to only render the name of the class or interface. Use the value `detailed` to also render properties and methods. | `detailed` |
| **location** `<local\|remote\|embed>` | Specifies the location of the generated images. If `local` then local image files are created in the assets directory of the generated documentation. If `remote` then the image tag uses an encoded link to a PlantUML web server that you can specify using the `remoteBaseUrl` option. If `embed` then the image is directly embedded into the HTML as a base64 encoded string. | `local` |
| **remoteBaseUrl** `<string>` | Specifies the base URL that is used when generating remote image URLs. An example image URL is `http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/svg/SyfFKj2rKt3CoKnELR1Io4ZDoSa70000` from which `http://www.plantuml.com` is the base URL. You can use this option if you are running your own [PlantUML PicoWeb Server](https://plantuml.com/picoweb). | `http://www.plantuml.com` |
| **format** `<png\|svg>` | Specifies the format the generated images should have. You can choose between `png` and `svg`. | `svg` |

### HTML output

| Name & Format | Description | Default |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------- |
| **sectionTitle** `<string>` | Specifies the title of the section on the TypeDoc page which includes the class diagram. | `Hierarchy-Diagram` |
| **position** `<above\|below>` | Specifies if the class diagram should be inserted `above` or `below` the default hierarchy section on the TypeDoc page. | `above` |
| **legendType** `<none\|only-included\|full>` | Use this option to add a legend below each class diagram explaining the icons (eg: visibility of properties and methods) used in it. If `full` every legend contains every possible icon in a class diagram. If `only-included` every legend contains only the icons that are included in the class diagram. | `only-included` |

### Class diagram formating

| Name & Format | Description | Default |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------- |
| **methodParameterOutput** `<none\|only-names\|only-types\|complete>`| Specifies how method parameters should be included in the class diagram. Use `none` to completely omit parameters, `only-names` to include only parameter names, `only-types` to include only parameter types and `complete` to include names and types. | `complete` |
| **memberOrder** `<abc\|public-to-private\|private-to-public>` | Specifies the order of properties and methods within the boxes in the class diagram. Use `abc` to sort them alphabetically, `public-to-private` to have public properties/methods before protected and private ones or `private-to-public` to have private properties/methods before protected and public ones. | `public-to-private` |
| **hideEmptyMembers** `<true\|false>` | If this option is set to true properties and methods are hidden if they are empty. | `true` |
| **topDownLayoutMaxSiblings** `<integer>` | Specifies the maximum number of allowed siblings above (extended types and implemented interfaces) and below (extending types and implementing interfaces) the current type. If this number is exceeded the PlantUML layout is switched from top/down to left/right to allow a better readability of the resulting class diagram. | `6` |
| **visibilityStyle** `<text\|icon>` | Specifies how the visibility (private, protected or public) of class members (properties and methods) should be rendered in the class diagrams. | `icon` |
| **hideCircledChar** `<true\|false>` | If this option is set to true the circled char in front of class and interface names is omitted. | `false` |
| **hideShadow** `<true\|false>` | If this option is set to true the shadowing in the class diagrams is disabled. | `false` |
| **backgroundColor** `<transparent\|#RGBHEX>` | Specifies the color used for the background of all class diagrams. | `transparent` |
| **boxBackgroundColor** `<transparent\|#RGBHEX>` | Specifies the background color of the boxes within the class diagram. | PlantUML default value |
| **boxBorderColor** `<transparent\|#RGBHEX>` | Specifies the border color of the boxes within the class diagram. | PlantUML default value |
| **boxBorderRadius** `<integer>` | Specifies the border radius of the boxes within the class diagram. Unit is pixel. | `0` |
| **boxBorderWidth** `<integer>` | Specifies the border width of the boxes within the class diagram. Unit is pixel. | PlantUML default value |
| **arrowColor** `<transparent\|#RGBHEX>` | Specifies the color of the arrows within the class diagram. | PlantUML default value |
| **classFontName** `<font-name>` | Specifies the name of the font used for the class names within the class diagram. **The PlantUML site remarks:** _Please note the fontname is highly system dependent, so do not over use it, if you look for portability. Helvetica and Courier should be available on all system._ | PlantUML default value |
| **classFontSize** `<integer>` | Specifies the font size of the class names within the class diagram. Unit is pixel. | PlantUML default value |
| **classFontStyle** `<normal\|plain\|italic\|bold>` | Specifies the style of the font used for the class names within the class diagram. | PlantUML default value |
| **classFontColor** `<transparent\|#RGBHEX>` | Specifies the color of the class names within the class diagram. | PlantUML default value |
| **attributeFontName** `<font-name>` | Specifies the name of the font used for class attributes within the class diagram. **The PlantUML site remarks:** _Please note the fontname is highly system dependent, so do not over use it, if you look for portability. Helvetica and Courier should be available on all system._ | PlantUML default value |
| **attributeFontSize** `<integer>` | Specifies the font size of the class attributes within the class diagram. Unit is pixel. | PlantUML default value |
| **attributeFontStyle** `<normal\|plain\|italic\|bold>` | Specifies the style of the font used for the class attributes within the class diagram. | PlantUML default value |
| **attributeFontColor** `<transparent\|#RGBHEX>` | Specifies the color of the class attributes within the class diagram. | PlantUML default value |

### Other settings

| Name & Format | Description | Default |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------- |
**generatorProcessCount** `<integer>` | Generating many diagrams can take several minutes. You can use this option to define how many PlantUML JAVA processes should be used to generate the diagrams. The work is evenly scheduled among these processes. | The number of virtual cores available on your system. |
**hideProgressBar** `<true\|false>` | Since generating many diagrams can take several minutes the plugin displays a progress bar when the diagrams are created as local files or embedded into the HTML. No progress bar is displayed when generating remote URLs. If other plugins also output information to the console then the progress bar can disturb that output. If this is the case you can disable the progress bar of this plugin using the value `true`. | `false` |
**createPlantUmlFiles** `<true\|false>` | If this option is set to `true` the plugin creates a text file for every class or interface for which a class diagram is generated. The file contains the PlantUML code that was used to create the diagram. The files are stored in the assets directory of the generated documentation. | `false` |
**verboseOutput** `<true\|false>` | If this option is set to `true` the plugin outputs messages to the console during its work. Use this option to debug possible plugin issues. | `false` |
